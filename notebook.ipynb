On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little at a time.\\n4. Once the mixture starts to come together, knead the dough with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. You can use a pasta machine or a rolling pin to roll out each portion into thin sheets. Make sure to dust the dough and work surface with flour to prevent sticking.\\n7. Once the pasta sheets are rolled out, you can cut them into your desired shape. Common shapes include fettuccine, spaghetti, or lasagna sheets.\\n8. If making long pasta shapes like spaghetti, you can hang them on a pasta drying rack or lay them flat on a clean surface to dry for a few minutes before cooking.\\n9. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, which means it should still have a slight bite to it. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness and shape of the pasta, so it's best to taste it as it cooks.\\n10.
