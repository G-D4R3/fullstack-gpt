       "AIMessage(content=\"Great choice! Butter Chicken is a popular Indian dish that is usually made with chicken. However, as a vegetarian chef, I can provide you with an alternative ingredient to replace the chicken. Here's a modified version of the recipe using paneer, a type of Indian cheese:\\n\\nIngredients:\\n- 250g paneer, cut into bite-sized cubes\\n- 2 tablespoons butter\\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\\n- 2 cloves of garlic, minced\\n- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\\n- 2 teaspoons garam masala\\n- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\\n- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)\\n- 1 cup tomato puree\\n- 1/2 cup heavy cream\\n- Salt to taste\\n- Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. Heat the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden brown.\\n2. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan. Cook for another minute until fragrant.\\n3. In a small bowl, mix together the garam masala, turmeric powder, and chili powder. Add this spice mixture to the pan and cook for a minute to release the flavors.\\n4. Add the paneer cubes to the pan and cook until they are lightly browned on all sides.\\n5. Pour in the tomato puree and stir well to combine. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the paneer is heated through.\\n6. Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt to taste. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.\\n7. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot with steamed rice or naan bread.\\n\\nBy replacing the chicken with paneer, you can still enjoy the rich flavors and creamy texture of Butter Chicken in a vegetarian-friendly way. Enjoy your homemade Paneer Butter Masala!\")"
